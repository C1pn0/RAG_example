A systematic review following STROBE guidelines and PECOS criteria was conducted to identify cohort studies describing the association between occupational DE exposure and the risk of skin cancer. We extracted 12 independent risk estimates for melanoma skin cancer (MSC), 8 for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and 3 for skin cancer not otherwise specified (SC-NOS). Random effects meta-analyses were performed, site-specific and stratified by geographic region and quality score. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Between-study heterogeneity and potential publication bias were investigated. There was no overall evidence of an increased risk of MSC [RR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.73-1.11; I2=92.86%, 95% CI: 82.83-97.03%], NMSC [RR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.88-1.23; I2=60.79%, 95% CI: 0-87.34%] or SC-NOS [RR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97; I2=26.60%, 95% CI: 0-94.87%] in workers exposed to DE. No difference between low-quality and high-quality studies was found. A stratified analysis by geographical region did not reveal any significant differences. There was no evidence of publication bias. No evidence of an association between skin cancer and occupational DE exposure was found. Residual confounding and other sources of bias cannot be ruled out.'}
{'pmid': '38686387', 'title': 'Identifying serum metabolite biomarkers for autoimmune diseases: a two-sample mendelian randomization and meta-analysis.', 'abstract': 'Extensive evidence suggests a link between alterations in serum metabolite composition and various autoimmune diseases (ADs). Nevertheless, the causal relationship underlying these correlations and their potential utility as dependable biomarkers for early AD detection remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to employ a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to ascertain the causal relationship between serum metabolites and ADs. Additionally, a meta-analysis incorporating data from diverse samples was conducted to enhance the validation of this causal effect. A two-sample MR analysis was performed to investigate the association between 486 human serum metabolites and six prevalent autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dermatomyositis (DM), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and celiac disease (CeD). The inverse variance weighted (IVW) model was employed as the primary analytical technique for the two-sample MR analysis, aiming to identify blood metabolites linked with autoimmune diseases. Independent outcome samples were utilized for further validation of significant blood metabolites. Additional sensitivity analyses, including heterogeneity test, horizontal pleiotropy test, and retention rate analysis, were conducted. The results from these analyses were subsequently meta-integrated. Finally, metabolic pathway analysis was performed using the KEGG and Small Molecule Pathway Databases (SMPD). Following the discovery and replication phases, eight metabolites were identified as causally associated with various autoimmune diseases, encompassing five lipid metabolism types: 1-oleoylglycerophosphoethanolamine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphoethanolamine, 1-myristoylglycerophosphocholine, arachidonate (20:4 n6), and glycerol. The meta-analysis indicated that three out of these eight metabolites exhibited a protective effect, while the remaining five were designated as pathogenic factors. The robustness of these associations was further confirmed through sensitivity analysis. Moreover, an investigation into metabolic pathways revealed a significant correlation between galactose metabolism and autoimmune diseases. This study revealed a causal relationship between lipid metabolites and ADs, providing novel insights into the mechanism of AD development mediated by serum metabolites and possible biomarkers for early diagnosis.'}

Probiotics are microorganisms that regulate host immunomodulation and have shown positive results in the treatment of peri-implant diseases. The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of peri-implant oral diseases. According to the PRISMA guidelines, the research question was established: Are probiotics able to favorably modify clinical and immunological biomarkers determinants of peri-implant pathologies? and an electronic search of the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, (until December 2023) was performed. Inclusion criteria were established for intervention studies (RCTs), according to the PICOs strategy in subjects with peri-implant pathology (participants), treated with probiotics (intervention) compared to patients with conventional treatment or placebo (control) and evaluating the response to treatment (outcomes). Results- 1723 studies were obtained and 10 were selected. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute for RCTs. Two meta-analyses were performed, one to evaluate probiotics in mucositis and one for peri-implantitis. All subgroups were homogeneous (I2\xa0=\xa00%), except in the analysis of IL-6 in mucositis (I2\xa0=\xa065%). The overall effect was favorable to the experimental group in both pathologies. The analysis of the studies grouped in peri-implantitis showed a tendency to significance (p=0.09). The use of probiotics, as basic or complementary treatment of peri-implant diseases, showed a statistically significant trend, but well-designed studies are warranted to validate the efficacy of these products in peri-implant pathologies.'}

To date, there are no epidemiological studies on the prevalence of and risk factors for hypertension among older people in mainland China. We conducted a meta-analysis of the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among the older population in mainland China. We searched Chinese and English databases for Chinese and English literature on hypertension epidemiology published between 2000 and 2022, and hypertension data among the older population were extracted from the included literature. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model (I2\u2009>\u200950%) with 95% confidence intervals for the forest plots. Data were processed using RevMan 5.3. Forty-nine publications (with data from 84,429 samples) met the evaluation criteria and were included in this study. We found that the total prevalence of hypertension was 47%. The total prevalence rate of the older population in China from 2000 to 2010 was 50%, and the prevalence rate from 2011 to 2021 was 45%, with no significant differences. The total prevalence in Central China was the highest (59%). There was no significant correlation between the prevalence rate of the older population, sex, and urban or rural areas. Hypertension is common among the older population in China, and its control rate is low. Therefore, effective prevention and treatment measures, as well as education, should be formulated to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the older population.'}

This study determined the effectiveness of CIMT using telerehabilitation compared with traditional CIMT in improving mild to moderate upper limb motor function in adult patients with chronic stroke. Eligible studies were identified by searching electronic databases and scanning the reference lists of articles. Review Manager 5.4 was used to determine the pooled mean effect size of the standardized mean difference and 95% confidence interval for the group comparison. Visual heterogeneity, I2 statistic, and chi-square test were used to measure the heterogeneity between the included studies. We evaluated the quality of evidence using GRADEpro GDT, software for creating evidence summaries and healthcare recommendations. Two randomized controlled trials were included in this review. A total of 109 participants (70 male, 39 female) were evaluated. The time since the stroke was ≥6\xa0months in one study and ≥1\xa0year in another study. Improvements in upper limb motor function while performing functional movements were measured using the Wolf Motor Function Test. The evidence for the effectiveness of CIMT using telerehabilitation compared with traditional CIMT in improving the upper extremity function in patients with chronic stroke is of moderate quality. This suggests no significant difference between the groups (mean difference [95% CI]: -0.04 [-0.42, 0.33]). CIMT using telerehabilitation is not superior to traditional CIMT in improving patients' upper extremity motor function with chronic stroke. CIMT using telerehabilitation may improve access to treatment, minimize SARS-CoV-2 risk, and reduce travel in patients with chronic stroke."}

Therefore, we performed an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with MetS and its components using two independent cohorts comprising a total of 2,334 participants. We also investigated the specific genetic effects on DNA methylation, identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) through genome-wide association studies and further utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess how these meQTLs subsequently influence MetS status. We identified 40 DMPs and 27 DMRs that are significantly associated with MetS. In addition, we identified many novel DMPs and DMRs underlying inflammatory and steroid hormonal processes. The most significant associations were observed in 3 DMPs (cg19693031, cg26974062, cg02988288) and a DMR (chr1:145440444-145441553) at the TXNIP, which are involved in lipid metabolism. These CpG sites were identified as coregulators of DNA methylation in MetS, TG and FAG levels. We identified a total of 144 cis-meQTLs, out of which only 13 were found to be associated with DMPs for MetS. Among these, we confirmed the identified causal mediators of genetic effects at CpG sites cg01881899 at ABCG1 and cg00021659 at the TANK genes for MetS. This study observed whether specific CpGs and methylated regions act independently or are influenced by genetic effects for MetS and its components in the Korean population. These associations between the identified DNA methylation and MetS, along with its individual components, may serve as promising targets for the development of preventive interventions for MetS.'}

Novel instrument-based antigen tests (iAg tests) hold the promise of outperforming their instrument-free, visually-read counterparts. Here, we provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 iAg tests' clinical accuracy. We systematically searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, medRxiv, and bioRxiv for articles published before November 7th, 2022, evaluating the accuracy of iAg tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate sensitivity and specificity and used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess study quality and risk of bias. Sub-group analysis was conducted based on Ct value range, IFU-conformity, age, symptom presence and duration, and the variant of concern. We screened the titles and abstracts of 20,431 articles and included 114 publications that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Additionally, we incorporated three articles sourced from the FIND website, totaling 117 studies encompassing 95,181 individuals, which evaluated the clinical accuracy of 24 commercial COVID-19 iAg tests. The studies varied in risk of bias but showed high applicability. Of 24 iAg tests from 99 studies assessed in the meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity compared to molecular testing of a paired NP swab sample were 76.7% (95% CI 73.5 to 79.7) and 98.4% (95% CI 98.0 to 98.7), respectively. Higher sensitivity was noted in individuals with high viral load (99.6% [95% CI 96.8 to 100] at Ct-level\u2009≤\u200920) and within the first week of symptom onset (84.6% [95% CI 78.2 to 89.3]), but did not differ between tests conducted as per manufacturer's instructions and those conducted differently, or between point-of-care and lab-based testing. Overall, iAg tests have a high pooled specificity but a moderate pooled sensitivity, according to our analysis. The pooled sensitivity increases with lower Ct-values (a proxy for viral load), or within the first week of symptom onset, enabling reliable identification of most COVID-19 cases and highlighting the importance of context in test selection. The study underscores the need for careful evaluation considering performance variations and operational features of iAg tests."}

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the prevalence, risk factors, and feto-maternal outcomes of HIP in Ethiopia. To gather relevant information for this study, both published and unpublished studies were searched for in several major databases, including PubMed, Embase, HINARI, Web of Science direct, and Google Scholar, as well as other sources. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the findings from these studies. Data was then extracted and summarized using a template in Microsoft Excel software, and the extracted data was analyzed using Stata software version 16.0. If significant heterogeneity was found between studies, subgroup analyses were conducted to further examine the data. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, involving a total sample size of 50,816 pregnant women in Ethiopia. The prevalence of HIP among pregnant women varied considerably across the primary studies, ranging from 0.4 to 26.2%. The pooled prevalence of HIP among pregnant women in Ethiopia was found to be 6.9% (95% C 2.2-11.6). Pregnant women with a family history of diabetes had 2.5 times higher odds of developing HIP compared to those without a family history of diabetes (OR\u2009=\u20092.49; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.02, 2.96). However, there was no significant association found between HIP and maternal obesity (OR 2.31, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85, 3.78) or previous history of abortion (OR 3.89; 95% CI 0.85, 6.94). The common fetal outcomes associated with HIP were admission to the intensive care unit (46.2; 95% CI 27.4, 65.1), macrosomia (27.3%; 95% CI 9.4%, 45.1%), and preterm birth (16.9; 95% CI 12.5, 21.3). Additionally, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (28.0%; 95% CI 15.2, 40.8) and operative delivery (51.4%; 95% CI 35.9, 66.8) were more common among women with HIP in Ethiopia. Although there was some variation between studies, the meta-analysis revealed that approximately seven out of 100 pregnant women in Ethiopia had HIP. A family history of diabetes was found to be a significant predictor of HIP in Ethiopia. Additionally, HIP was associated with various serious adverse outcomes for both mothers and infants in Ethiopia. These findings highlight the need for national guidelines to ensure that pregnant women are uniformly screened for HIP.'}

We aimed to define the genetic determinants of T2D in Qatar. Using whole genome sequencing of 11,436 participants (2765 T2D cases and 8671 controls) from the population-based Qatar Biobank (QBB), we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of T2D with and without body mass index (BMI) adjustment. We replicated 93 known T2D-associated loci in a BMI-unadjusted model, while 96 known loci were replicated in a BMI-adjusted model. The effect sizes and allele frequencies of replicated SNPs in the Qatari population generally concurred with those from European populations. We identified a locus specific to our cohort located between the APOBEC3H and CBX7 genes in the BMI-unadjusted model. Also, we performed a transethnic meta-analysis of our cohort with a previous GWAS on T2D in multi-ancestry individuals (180,834 T2D cases and 1,159,055 controls). One locus in DYNC2H1 gene reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. Assessing polygenic risk scores derived from European- and multi-ancestries in the Qatari population showed higher predictive performance of the multi-ancestry panel compared to the European panel. Our study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of T2D in a Middle Eastern population and identifies genes that may be explored further for their involvement in T2D pathogenesis.'}

Previous studies on these diseases have tended to focus on lipid parameters and periodontitis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between dyslipidemia and periodontitis. A comprehensive search to identify the studies investigating the relationship between dyslipidemia and periodontitis was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library before the date of August, 2023. Studies were considered eligible if they contained data on abnormal blood lipid parameters and periodontitis. Studies that reported mean differences and 95% confidence intervals or odds ratios were used. A total of 73 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Hyper total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are risk factors for periodontitis. Periodontal disease is a risk factor for high TG and low HDL levels. Three months after periodontal treatment, the levels of TC, TG and HDL were significantly improved, and statin treatment only improved gingival index (GI) levels compared to that of the dietary control. The findings reported here suggest that the mutual promotion of periodontitis and dyslipidemia can be confirmed. Non-surgical periodontal therapy may improve lipid abnormalities. It can't be demonstrated whether systematic application of statins have a better effect on the improvement in periodontal status in patients with dyslipidemia compared to that of the control."}

Meta-analysis was used to combine the effect values of IVW methods in different data sources. Weight, BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, hip circumference and BMR analyses showed causal association with increased KOA risk, while WHR analysis indicated a reduction of the incidence of KOA. P-value for all the results was less than 0.05 and F-value large than 20. All results were negative for heterogeneity tests and sensitivity analyses, and there was pleiotropy in weight and BMR. Meta-analysis results showed that the results of Odds Ratios (95% Confidence Intervals) for Weight (1.43(1.35-1.51)), BMI (1.40(1.10-1.78)), body fat percentage (1.56(1.44-1.68)), waist circumference (1.40(1.10-1.78)), hip circumference (1.37(1.30-1.44)), WHR (0.86(0.71-1.04)) and BMR (1.36(1.27-1.46) were consistent with the ones by Mendelian randomization analyses. Body fat percentage may be a better indicator of KOA than BMI. In addition, weight and BMR may have a causal effect in KOA, but WHR does not have a causal relationship. BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, and hip circumference has a causal effect on KOA.'}

This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy of inflammatory biomarkers, including the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as predictive tools of mortality among burn patients. The biomarker levels of survivors and non-survivors were consolidated according to guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Three main databases were searched electronically: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, on December 8, 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate and score the methodological quality of the included studies. The standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized. Twenty-four studies were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis, (3636 total burn patients), of whom 2878 survived. We found that deceased burn patients had elevated levels of NLR (SMD\u2009=\u20090.60, 95% CI; 0.19-1.00, P\u2009<\u20090.001), CRP (SMD\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% CI; 0.02-1.58, P\u2009=\u20090.04), and PCT (SMD\u2009=\u20090.85, 95% CI; 0.45-1.24, P\u2009<\u20090.001), compared to survivors.

In addition, CRP was significantly higher in non-survivors (SMD = 0.80, 95% CI; 0.02-1.58, P =0.04). Similar results were also found about PCT\xa0(SMD = 0.85, 95% CI; 0.45-1.24, P < 0.001).\xa0When we analyzed the PCT data, collected in the first 24-48 hours, we found similar results; the PCT level was significantly higher in non-survivors in the immediate postinjury-period (SMD = 0.67, 95% CI; 0.31-1.02, P < 0.001).\xa0There was no publication bias among studies on the role of NLR in burn (Egger's test P\u2009=\u20090.91). The based cut-off values for NLR (13), CRP (71), and PCT (1.77) yielded sensitivities of 69.2%, 100%, and 93.33%, and specificities of 76%, 72.22%, and 72.22% respectively. PCT is a marker of sepsis, therefore its elevated level is presumably associated with a higher incidence and severity of sepsis among non-survivors. In addition, NLR and CRP are promising biomarkers for predicting and guiding prevention against burn deaths in clinical settings."}

We conducted a comprehensive search of domestic and foreign databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang to retrieve literature on radiofrequency ablation and liver resection for the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma. The retrieved literature underwent thorough screening, and relevant data were extracted. Following the evaluation of the literature's quality, Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. In this study, a total of 11 documents were selected, comprising 1334 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Meta-analysis results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in the 1-year overall survival rate [Relative risk (RR) = 1.01, 95% confidence intervals (CI) (0.98; 1.04)] and the 3-year overall survival rate [RR = 0.95, 95% CI (0.90; 1.01)] between the radiofrequency ablation and liver resection groups (p > 0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the 1-year disease-free survival rate [RR = 0.94, 95% CI (0.87; 1.01)] between the two groups. However, the 3-year disease-free survival rate [RR = 0.84, 95% CI (0.74; 0.96)] of patients in the radiofrequency ablation group was significantly lower than that in the hepatectomy group (p < 0.05). Notably, the incidence of complications [RR = 0.42, 95% CI (0.33; 0.55)] was significantly lower in the radiofrequency ablation group compared to the hepatectomy group. Conversely, the local recurrence rate [RR = 1.45, 95% CI (1.22; 1.73)] was significantly higher in the radiofrequency ablation group compared to the hepatectomy group (p < 0.05). During the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatectomy demonstrates superior clinical efficacy compared to radiofrequency ablation, particularly in its ability to control tumor recurrence. However, radiofrequency ablation presents with fewer complications and a higher level of safety. These findings can serve as a valuable foundation for clinicians when selecting the most suitable treatment approaches for liver cancer."}

Vitamin D is routinely recommended for bone health in general population. Our study explores the potential association between low levels (≤20 ng/mL) of vitamin D and mortality in hip fracture patients. Systematic search was done for studies that were published from inception until May 10, 2023, and that report a possible correlation between low vitamin D levels and mortality in patients with hip fractures. A random-effects model was used to assess the effects of normal vitamin D levels on mortality, subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the link between low levels of vitamin D and geographic location of the study and its impact on the recovery process. In 575 identified studies, 18 met the inclusion criteria. A strong connection between low serum levels of vitamin D (<20 ng/mL) and mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 2.29, p<0.001). Further analysis indicated that insufficient (20 to 30 ng/mL) and sufficient (>30 ng/mL) levels of vitamin D levels did not have a significant association with the mortality (HR: 1.10, p=0.12), and (HR: 1.04, p=0.50). As shown by subgroup analysis vitamin D deficiency significantly correlated with mortality in studies conducted in Europe (HR: 2.4). Our results clearly demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of mortality in hip fracture patients. Additional analyses demonstrate that insufficient and sufficient levels of vitamin D were not significantly associated with mortality outcomes in hip fracture patients.'}

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing CPMs combined with T/Q for H. pylori-positive peptic ulcers were included. The CPMs included Anweiyang capsule, Jianweiyuyang tablets/capsule/granule, Jinghuaweikang capsule, Kangfuxin liquid, Puyuanhewei capsule, Weifuchun tablets/capsule and Weisu granule. At least one of the following outcome indicators was recorded: complete ulcer healing rate (CUHR), effective rate (ER), H. pylori eradication rate (HPER), rate of peptic ulcer recurrence (RPUR) and incidence of adverse reactions (IAR). Two researchers independently conducted the study selection and extracted data for included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A pairwise meta-analysis was performed using RevMan V.5.3. Network meta-analysis was performed using STATA/MP V.15.0. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. A total of 36 RCTs involving 3620 patients were included.

However, the drivers of success in salt marsh planting and their ecological effects are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we assemble a global database, encompassing 22,074 observations reported in 210 studies, to examine the drivers and impacts of salt marsh planting. We show that, on average, 53% of plantings survived globally, and plant survival and growth can be enhanced by careful design of sites, species selection, and novel planted technologies. Planting enhances shoreline protection, primary productivity, soil carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and fishery production (effect sizes\u2009=\u20090.61, 1.55, 0.21, 0.10 and 1.01, respectively), compared with degraded wetlands. However, the ecosystem services of planted marshes, except for shoreline protection, have not yet fully recovered compared with natural wetlands (effect size\u2009=\u2009-0.25, 95% CI\u2009-0.29, -0.22). Fortunately, the levels of most ecological functions related to climate change mitigation and biodiversity increase with plantation age when compared with natural wetlands, and achieve equivalence to natural wetlands after 5-25\u2009years. Overall, our results suggest that salt marsh planting could be used as a strategy to enhance shoreline protection, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration.'}

Despite its significance, the risk stratification of CIP in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains uncertain. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis, comparing various factors such as histological types, treatment regimens, PD-L1 expression levels, and EGFR/ALK negativity in advanced NSCLC. Our investigation extends to evaluating the relative risk of developing CIP based on previous treatment history. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights for the identification of specific patient subgroups at higher risk, facilitating more effective risk management and precision therapy approaches. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched up to February 16, 2023. We conducted a screening of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ICI monotherapy or its combination with chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. The trials were categorized based on histological type, treatment regimen, PD-L1 expression level, EGFR/ALK-negative status, and prior treatment history. Subsequently, the data were stratified into five subgroups, and the occurrences of all-grades (1-5) and high-grades (3-5) pneumonia events were extracted. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then calculated for further analysis. Twenty-two RCTs, encompassing 13,725 patients with advanced NSCLC, were included in this analysis.

Subgroup analysis revealed that the squamous group, the ICI vs. combination chemotherapy (CT) group, the PD-L1 > 50% group, and the previously untreated group had a higher risk of developing all-grade and grade 3-5 CIP (P < 0.05). In advanced NSCLC, ICI treatment was linked to an elevated risk of pneumonitis across all grades (1-5) as well as high-grade occurrences (3-5) compared to chemotherapy. Notably, individuals with squamous histology and high PD-L1 expression, along with those lacking a history of prior treatment, demonstrated a heightened susceptibility to developing immune-related pneumonitis of all grades (1-5) and high grades (3-5). These observations provide valuable insights for clinicians seeking to enhance the management of pulmonary toxicity associated with immunotherapy.'}

Moreover, the value of adding adjunct therapies (i.e. injections, manual therapy, electrotherapy) to ET is currently unclear. This study combined both direct and indirect evidence across studies on the effectiveness of ET with/without adjunct therapies compared to usual medical care for adults with chronic shoulder pain. Using a network meta-analysis, randomized control trials comparing ET along with adjunct therapies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Sportdiscus, CENTRAL, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and association websites. Outcomes included pain, range of motion (ROM), and health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in adult patients with chronic shoulder pain. Data analysis used a Frequentist hierarchical model. CINeMA tool assessed the confidence in the results and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool assessed quality of studies. 54 studies primarily from Europe (40.38%) included 3,893 participants who were followed up to 52 weeks. Shoulder-specific ET (Mean difference (MD) = -2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.5 to -0.7) or in combination with electro-physical agents (MD = -2.5; 95% CI = -4.2 to -0.7), injections (MD = -2.4; 95% CI = -3.9 to-1.04) or manual therapy (MD = -2.3; 95% CI = -3.7 to -0.8) decreased pain compared to usual medical care. Trends with ROM and HRQL scores were seen; however, only Manual Therapy (MD = -12.7 and 95% CI = -24.4 to -1.0) achieved meaningfully important changes. Sensitivity analysis excluding studies with high risk of bias showed similar results, with exception of injections that did not reach significance (MD = -1.3; 95% CI = -4.3 to 1.7). Shoulder-specific ET provided pain relief up to 52 weeks. Adjunct therapies to shoulder-specific ET added little value in reducing pain.

Related literatures that compared inverted ILM flap and ILM peeling in MHs ≤ 400 μm were reviewed by searching electronic databases including Pubmed, EMbase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library up to April 2023. The primary outcome measure was hole closure rate, and the secondary outcome measures were the mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), retinal sensitivity, and outer status of the retinal layers, including the external limiting membrane and ellipsoid zone. The quality of the articles was assessed according to the revised version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials or the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. In the case of heterogeneity, a sensitivity analysis was conducted, and publication bias was visually evaluated using a funnel plot. This review included six studies with 610 eyes for the primary outcome and 385 eyes for the secondary outcomes, which were two randomized control trials and four retrospective studies. Pooled data revealed that the overall MH closure rate was 99.4% in the inverted ILM flap group and 96.2% in the ILM peeling group, without significant difference between the two groups (odds ratio = 3.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.82~18.69; P = 0.09). The inverted ILM flap technique did not have a favorable effect on the BCVA, retinal sensitivity, or recovery of the outer retinal layers. These results were consistent with those of the subgroup analysis of the different follow-up periods. No significant publication bias was observed. In eyes with MHs of ≤400 μm, both techniques demonstrated excellent surgical outcomes without significant differences. Therefore, surgical techniques can be selected according to surgeon preferences.'}

The analysis included five studies meeting the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1440 patients (814 undergoing RP-RAPN and 626 undergoing TP-RAPN). Both groups showed no significant differences in age, gender, BMI, R.E.N.A.L. score, and tumor size.

Full articles comparing clinical outcomes of robotic myomectomy with open or laparoscopic procedures were included without language restriction. Initially, 2150 records were found. 24 studies were finally included for both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Two investigators independently assessed all reports following PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis was conducted using the software "Review Manager Version 5.4". Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, when feasible. In a comparison between robotic and laparoscopic myomectomies, no significant difference was observed in fibroid weights and the size of the largest fibroid. Robotic myomectomy resulted in less blood loss, but transfusion rates were comparable. Both methods had similar complication rates and operative times, although some robotic studies showed longer durations. Conversion rates favored robotics. Hospital stays varied widely, with no overall significant difference, and pregnancy rates were similar between the two methods. When comparing robotic to open myomectomies, open procedures treated heavier and larger fibroids. They also had greater blood loss, but the robotic approach required fewer transfusions. The complication rate was slightly higher in open procedures. Open surgeries were generally faster, postoperative pain scores were similar, but hospital stays were longer for open procedures. Pregnancy rates were comparable for both robotic and open methods. Robotic surgery offers advancement in myomectomy procedures by offering enhanced exposure and dexterity, leading to reduced blood loss and improved patient outcomes.

Uncomplicated/simple appendicitis can be treated with appendectomy or antibiotics. Some studies have suggested possible benefits with antibiotics with reduced complications, length of hospital stay, and the number of days off work. However, surgery may improve success of treatment as antibiotic treatment is associated with recurrence and future need for surgery. To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated/simple acute appendicitis compared with appendectomy for resolution of symptoms and complications. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) on 19 July 2022. We also searched for unpublished studies in conference proceedings together with reference checking and citation search. There were no restrictions on date, publication status, or language of publication. We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies where most participants were adults with uncomplicated/simple appendicitis. Interventions included antibiotics (by any route) compared with appendectomy (open or laparoscopic). We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes included mortality and success of treatment, and secondary outcomes included number of participants requiring appendectomy in the antibiotic group, complications, pain, length of hospital stay, sick leave, malignancy in the antibiotic group, negative appendectomy rate, and quality of life. Success of treatment definitions were heterogeneous although mainly based on resolution of symptoms rather than incorporation of long-term recurrence or need for surgery in the antibiotic group. We included 13 studies in the review covering 1675 participants randomised to antibiotics and 1683 participants randomised to appendectomy. One study was unpublished. All were conducted in secondary care and two studies received pharmaceutical funding. All studies used broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens expected to cover gastrointestinal bacteria. Most studies used predominantly laparoscopic surgery, but some included mainly open procedures. Six studies included adults and children. Almost all studies aimed to exclude participants with complicated appendicitis prior to randomisation, although one study included 12% with perforation. The diagnostic technique was clinical assessment and imaging in most studies. Only one study limited inclusion by sex (male only). Follow-up ranged from hospital admission only to seven years. Certainty of evidence was mainly affected by risk of bias (due to lack of blinding and loss to follow-up) and imprecision. Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether there was any difference in mortality due to the very low-certainty evidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.95; 1 study, 492 participants). There may be 76 more people per 1000 having unsuccessful treatment in the antibiotic group compared with surgery, which did not reach our predefined level for clinical significance (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96; I2 = 69%; 7 studies, 2471 participants; low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes At one year, 30.7% (95% CI 24.0 to 37.8; I2 = 80%; 9 studies, 1396 participants) of participants in the antibiotic group required appendectomy or, alternatively, more than two-thirds of antibiotic-treated participants avoided surgery in the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding complications, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea due to very low-certainty evidence (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.89; 1 study, 1332 participants). There may be a clinically significant reduction in wound infections with antibiotics (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.68; I2 = 16%; 9 studies, 2606 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether antibiotics affect the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess or collection (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.07; I2 = 19%; 6 studies, 1831 participants), or reoperation (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.16; 1 study, 492 participants) due to very low-certainty evidence, mainly due to rare events causing imprecision and risk of bias. It is uncertain if antibiotics prolonged length of hospital stay by half a day due to the very low-certainty evidence (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.01; I2 = 97%; 11 studies, 3192 participants). The incidence of malignancy was 0.3% (95% CI 0 to 1.5; 5 studies, 403 participants) in the antibiotic group although follow-up was variable. Antibiotics probably increased the number of negative appendectomies at surgery (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.54 to 6.49; I2 = 17%; 5 studies, 707 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics may be associated with higher rates of unsuccessful treatment for 76 per 1000 people, although differences may not be clinically significant. It is uncertain if antibiotics increase length of hospital stay by half a day. Antibiotics may reduce wound infections. A third of the participants initially treated with antibiotics required subsequent appendectomy or two-thirds avoided surgery within one year, but the evidence is very uncertain. There were too few data from the included studies to comment on major complications.'}

Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included studies evaluating ACEi or ARB alone or in combination, compared to each other, placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

ARB have uncertain effects on withdrawal from treatment (3 studies, 721 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.26; I2 = 2%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (6 studies, 878 participants: RR 3.36, 95% CI 0.93 to 12.07; low certainty). ARB may prevent kidney failure (3 studies, 3227 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; I2 = 0%; low certainty), doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (4 studies, 3280 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; I2 = 32%; low certainty), and the progression from microalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (5 studies, 815 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; I2 = 74%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi, ARB had uncertain effects on all-cause death (15 studies, 1739 participants: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.88; I2 = 0%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (6 studies, 612 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28; I2 = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (13 studies, 1606 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.98; I2 = 0%; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 837 participants: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.07; I2 = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 767 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ACEi alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (6 studies, 1166 participants: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.40; I2 = 20%; low certainty), withdrawal from treatment (2 studies, 172 participants: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.86; I2 = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 994 participants: RR 3.02, 95% CI 0.61 to 14.85; low certainty), kidney failure (3 studies, 880 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.32; I2 = 0%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (2 studies, 813 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.85; I2 = 0%; low certainty). Compared to ACEi plus ARB, ARB alone has uncertain effects on all-cause death (7 studies, 2607 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.37; I2 = 0%; low certainty), withdrawn from treatment (3 studies, 1615 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.24; I2 = 0%; low certainty), cardiovascular death (4 studies, 992 participants: RR 3.03, 95% CI 0.62 to 14.93; low certainty), kidney failure (4 studies, 2321 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.95; I2 = 29%; low certainty), and doubling of SCr (3 studies, 2252 participants: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.64; I2 = 0%; low certainty). Comparative effects of different ACEi or ARB and low-dose versus high-dose ARB were rarely evaluated. No study compared different doses of ACEi. Adverse events of ACEi and ARB were rarely reported. ACEi or ARB may make little or no difference to all-cause and cardiovascular death compared to placebo or no treatment in people with diabetes and kidney disease but may prevent kidney failure. ARB may prevent the doubling of SCr and the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria compared with a placebo or no treatment. Despite the international guidelines suggesting not combining ACEi and ARB treatment, the effects of ACEi or ARB monotherapy compared to dual therapy have not been adequately assessed. The limited data availability and the low quality of the included studies prevented the assessment of the benefits and harms of ACEi or ARB in people with diabetes and kidney disease. Low and very low certainty evidence indicates that it is possible that further studies might provide different results.'}

Rates vary between countries, and are estimated to be 10% globally, with up to 25% in Europe. To assess the efficacy of psychosocial interventions and medications to reduce or stop alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (via CRSLive), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, from inception to 8 January 2024. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and included studies. We included randomised controlled trials that compared medications or psychosocial interventions, or both, to placebo, no intervention, usual care, or other medications or psychosocial interventions used to reduce or stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Our primary outcomes of interest were abstinence from alcohol, reduction in alcohol consumption, retention in treatment, and women with any adverse event. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We included eight studies (1369 participants) in which pregnant women received an intervention to stop or reduce alcohol use during pregnancy. In one study, almost half of participants had a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD); in another study, 40% of participants had a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. Six studies took place in the USA, one in Spain, and one in the Netherlands. All included studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions; we did not find any study that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. Pregnant women received the psychosocial intervention approximately at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the psychosocial intervention. Women in the control group received treatment as usual (TAU) or similar treatments such as comprehensive assessment of alcohol use and advice to stop drinking during pregnancy. Globally, we found that, compared to TAU, psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuously abstinent participants (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.57; I2 =0%; 3 studies; 378 women; low certainty evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference -0.42, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.28; I2 = 86%; 2 studies; 157 women; very low certainty evidence). Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 7 studies; 1283 women; moderate certainty evidence). None of the included studies assessed adverse events of treatments. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision of the estimates. Brief psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of psychosocial interventions and other treatments (e.g. medications) for women with AUD. These studies should provide detailed information on alcohol use before and during pregnancy using consistent measures such as the number of drinks per drinking day. When heterogeneous populations are recruited, more detailed information on alcohol use during pregnancy should be provided to allow future systematic reviews to be conducted. Other important information that would enhance the usefulness of these studies would be the presence of other comorbid conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders, and the use of other psychoactive substances.'}

Research has suggested that intrauterine or intraovarian infusion/injection of PRP before embryo transfer may improve endometrial receptivity and response to ovarian stimulation in women undergoing assisted reproduction. We compared these interventions to standard treatment, placebo, or other interventions (mechanical or pharmacological). To assess the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine and intraovarian infusion/injection of platelet-rich plasma in infertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology cycles. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Epistemonikos database in January 2023. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted the trial authors and experts in the field for any additional trials. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the application of PRP in the uterine cavity, ovaries, or both versus no intervention, placebo, or any other intervention (either mechanical or pharmacological) in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. We followed standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, including use of the updated risk of bias tool (RoB 2). The primary outcomes were live birth (or ongoing pregnancy) and miscarriage. The secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, complications of the procedure, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and fetal abnormality. We estimated the average effect of the interventions by fitting a Der Simonian-Laird's random-effects meta-analysis model. We reported pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We restricted the primary analyses to trials at low risk of bias for the outcomes and performed sensitivity analyses that included all studies. We included 12 parallel-group RCTs that recruited a total of 1069 women. We identified three different comparison groups. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for almost all outcomes. Intrauterine injection/infusion of platelet-rich plasma versus no intervention or placebo Nine studies evaluated intrauterine PRP versus no intervention or placebo. Eight included women with at least two or three previous implantation failures. Only one was assessed at low risk of bias for each outcome. This study provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of intrauterine PRP injection versus no intervention on live birth (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.14; 94 women) and miscarriage (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.09; 94 women). If the likelihood of live birth following no intervention is assumed to be 17%, then the likelihood following intrauterine PRP would be 7% to 40%; and if the risk of miscarriage following no intervention is 4%, then the risk following intrauterine PRP would be 1% to 24%. When we analyzed all studies (regardless of risk of bias), we found very low-certainty evidence about the effect of intrauterine PRP compared with placebo or no intervention on live birth or ongoing pregnancy (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.86; I² = 54%; 6 studies, 564 women) and miscarriage (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.01; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 504 women). The study at low risk of bias provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of intrauterine PRP compared with no intervention on clinical pregnancy (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.76; 94 women) and ectopic pregnancy (OR 2.94, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.95; 94 women). The synthesis of all studies provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of intrauterine PRP compared with placebo or no intervention on clinical pregnancy (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.27; I² = 24%; 9 studies, 824 women), multiple pregnancy (OR 2.68, 95% CI 0.81 to 8.88; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 240 women), and ectopic pregnancy (OR 2.94, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.95; 1 study, 94 women; very low-certainty evidence). Intrauterine infusion of PRP may increase the risk of preterm delivery compared with no intervention (OR 8.02, 95% CI 1.72 to 37.33; 1 study, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported pain, infection, allergic reaction, fetal growth restriction, or fetal abnormality. Intrauterine infusion of platelet-rich plasma versus intrauterine infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Two RCTs evaluated intrauterine PRP versus intrauterine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); both included women with thin endometrium, and neither was judged at low risk of bias for any outcome. We are uncertain about the effect of intrauterine PRP compared with intrauterine G-CSF on live birth (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.81; 1 study, 132 women; very low-certainty evidence), miscarriage (OR 1.94, 95% CI 0.63 to 5.96; 1 study, 132 women; very low-certainty evidence), and clinical pregnancy (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.35; 2 studies, 172 women; very low-certainty evidence). Neither study reported adverse outcomes other than miscarriage. Intraovarian injection of platelet-rich plasma versus no intervention One RCT evaluated PRP injection into both ovaries versus no intervention; it was judged at high risk of bias for the two outcomes it reported. We are uncertain about the effect of intraovarian PRP injection compared with no intervention on ongoing pregnancy (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.63; 73 women; very low-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.60; 73 women; very low-certainty evidence). The study examined no safety outcomes. We are uncertain about the effect of intrauterine or intraovarian administration of PRP on outcomes of assisted reproduction technology in infertile women. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution. Only one of the 12 included studies was judged at low risk of bias. Other limitations of the included trials were failure to report live birth, poor reporting of methods, lack of prospective protocol registration, low precision due to the small number of enrolled participants, indirectness due to the specific subpopulations and settings studied, and insufficient or absent safety data."}

We designed a pooled analysis of Kaplan-Meier-derived individual patient data from studies with follow-up for overall survival (all-cause death). Restricted mean survival time was calculated to evaluate lifetime gain or loss. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS-I) was used to assess risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to assess certainty of evidence. Eight studies met our eligibility criteria, including a total of 654 patients (311 patients treated with surgery and 343 patients treated with medical therapy alone). All the studies were non-randomized and observational. The median follow-up was 4.6\xa0years (interquartile range 1.0 to 7.7). Patients who underwent surgery had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared with patients receiving medical therapy alone (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.74, p <0.001). The restricted mean survival time was overall 1.1\xa0years greater with surgery compared with medical therapy, and this difference was statistically significant (p <0.001), which means that surgery is associated with lifetime gain. The overall risk of bias (ROBINS-I) was considered moderate-to-serious and the certainty of evidence (GRADE) was deemed to be low. In conclusion, in the overall follow-up, surgery as the initial approach was associated with better late survival and lifetime gain in comparison with medical therapy alone in the setting of acute type A aortic intramural hematoma; however, high-quality randomized trials are warranted to establish the efficacy of the surgical strategy.'}

A comprehensive search across seven databases was conducted up to January 31, 2024, to identify studies relevant to the occurrence of HZ following COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The meta-analysis included five studies on postinfection HZ and 13 studies on postvaccination HZ. Patients infected with COVID-19 had a 2.16-fold increased risk of HZ (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-3.76) than uninfected individuals. However, there was no significant association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of HZ compared to controls, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.84-1.39). Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of 74 postinfection and 153 postvaccination HZ studies found no significant differences on gender or age (<50 and ≥50 years) following COVID-19 infection. Notably, 44.0% of the HZ cases postinfection appeared within the first week, with 69.5% resolving within 10 days, predominantly presenting as skin lesions. In the postvaccination group, the majority (60.1%) developed HZ after the first dose and 66.7% occurred within 1 week. Moreover, 44.6% resolved within 10 days and 50.0% within a month, primarily exhibiting skin lesions and postherpetic neuralgia. The study found that COVID-19 infection increases the risk of HZ, but the COVID-19 vaccine does not. Further study is needed to explore the association between COVID-19 and HZ.'}

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were pelvic cancer survivors; psychosocial interventions; studies with a control group and measures of sexual health. Five databases were searched for literature along with an inspection of the included studies' reference lists to extend the search. Risk of bias was assessed with the RoB2 tool. Standardised mean difference (SMD) with a random effects model was used to determine the effect size of psychosocial interventions for sexual health in patients with pelvic cancers. Thirteen studies were included, with a total number of 1,541 participants. There was a large heterogeneity regarding the type of psychosocial intervention used with the source found in a leave one out analysis. Six studies showed statistically significant improvements in sexual health, while three showed positive but non-significant effects.\xa0The summary effect size estimate was small SMD = 0.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.42, p = 0.01). There is limited research on psychosocial interventions for sexual health in pelvic cancer patients. There are also limitations in the different pelvic cancer diagnoses examined. Commonly, the included articles examined physical function rather than the whole sexual health spectrum. The small effect sizes may in part be due to evaluation of psychosocial interventions by measuring physical dysfunction. Future research should broaden sexual health assessment tools and expand investigations to more cancer types."}

Amid the final eleven included studies, based on the random-effects model, the estimation of the pooled prevalence of Toxocara spp. was 20.8% (95% CI, 9.8-38.7%). The association between the risk factors of toxocariasis and the prevalence of the disease was not statistically significant. In the present study, significant prevalence was reported; however, considering the limited number of studies, it seems that the actual prevalence of the disease is higher.

Breast reconstructive surgery aims to restore the shape of the breast after a mastectomy. Two common approaches used today are tissue-based or autologous and implant-based reconstruction. Autologous breast reconstruction has the advantage of being more affordable, but the resulting shape is less attractive. At the same time, the implant technique produces a more pleasing shape at a more expensive cost. To compare the level of patients' satisfaction after breast reconstruction using the implant technique with the autologous technique using the Breast-Q questionnaire. This research was a meta-analytic study to compare patients' satisfaction levels with breast reconstruction using the autologous technique compared with the implant technique. We searched several research articles from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 2014 to 2023. Then, we conducted an analysis using Revman 5.4. The results of the study were presented in a forest plot diagram. From the search results, there were 3980 studies. Then, exclusion and inclusion were carried out, and the results obtained were 16 research articles. Of the 16 studies, analysis was then carried out, and the results obtained were satisfaction in breast patients with a sample size of 7284. The standard result of the mean difference was 0.55 (95% CI 0.41-0.68) p < 0.00001. Satisfaction with the reconstruction results with a sample size of 2935. The standard result of the mean difference was 0.48 (95% CI 0.28-0.69) p < 0.00001. Patients' sexual satisfaction with a sample size of 7149. The standard result of the mean difference was 0.27 (95% CI 0.17-0.37) p < 0.00001. Patients' satisfaction with nipple shapes with a sample of 426.

The role of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) polymorphism in the susceptibility to cervical cancer has been a subject of interest. However, the current evidence regarding this association remains inconclusive. To address this uncertainty, eligible studies were systematically searched and retrieved from various databases including Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang database. The search was conducted until September 01, 2023. The collected literature was then subjected to independent analysis by two authors. The pooled odds ratio along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval was calculated using different genetic models. Additionally, sensitivity and cumulative analyses were performed to assess the stability of the obtained results. A total of 29 case-control studies involving 8850 cases and 9286 controls were included in the present analysis. The findings revealed that the TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism increased the risk of cervical cancer under the allele genetic model (A vs. G: OR = 1.277, 95% CI = 1.104-1.477, P = 0.001) in the general population. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity demonstrated that this polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in Caucasian and African women, but not in Asians. Furthermore, subgroup analysis based on country of origin indicated a significant correlation between the TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism and an increased risk of cervical cancer in American and Chinese women, but not in Iranian women. The findings from this meta-analysis suggest that the TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism is a risk factor for cervical cancer in the general population, particularly in Caucasian and African women. However, further well-designed studies are warranted to validate these findings.'}

The nodes were bissected along their long axis and wet surface was imprinted on to clean glass slides followed by toluidine blue and rapid Papanicolaou staining. Subsequently the lymph node slices were cut at three levels using the cryostat machine and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin stain. The cytological and FS findings were compared and the specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of TIC and FS was evaluated taking histopathological diagnosis as gold standard. In addition, pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy for touch imprint cytology and frozen section were assessed for the studies included in the meta-analysis. The specificity, sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of touch imprint cytology were 100%, 88.2%, 90%, 100% and 60% respectively.

The pooled sensitivity and specificity for touch imprint cytology were 85.24% (95% CI, 83.46%-86.90%), and 98.99% (95% CI, 98.69%-99.23%) respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for frozen section examination were 90.45% (95% CI, 85.15%-94.34%), and 100% (95% CI, 99.24%-100%) respectively. Even though the sensitivity of FS was better than imprint cytology in detection of micrometastasis, TIC is a rapid inexpensive technique which can be utilized in remote areas in absence of cryostat machine. The sensitivity of the two techniques with respect to detection of macrometastasis was comparable. This meta-analysis highlights the accuracy of the touch imprint cytology and frozen section examination in the intra-operative detection of malignancy in breast cancer.'}

We aimed to estimate the relative effectiveness between acupuncture and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) through indirect treatment comparison (ITC) meta-analysis. We searched Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library from database inception until April 13, 2023. Randomized controlled trials of TCAs or acupuncture in the prevention of TTH in adults were included. The primary outcome was headache frequency. The secondary outcomes were headache intensity, responder rate, and adverse event rate. Bayesian random-effect models were used to perform ITC meta-analysis, and confidence of evidence was evaluated by using the GRADE approach. A total of 34 trials involving 4426 participants were included. Acupuncture had similar effect with TCAs in decreasing TTH frequency (amitriptyline: mean difference [MD] -1.29, 95% CI -5.28 to 3.02; amitriptylinoxide: MD -0.05, 95% CI -6.86 to 7.06) and reducing TTH intensity (amitriptyline: MD 2.35, 95% CI -1.20 to 5.78; clomipramine: MD 1.83, 95% CI -4.23 to 8.20). Amitriptyline had a higher rate of adverse events than acupuncture (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.42 to 14.23). Acupuncture had similar effect as TCAs in reducing headache frequency of TTH, and acupuncture had a lower adverse events rate than amitriptyline, as shown by very low certainty of evidence.'}

However, several systematic reviews included meta-analyses in favor of mistletoe. The aim of this work was to assess the influence of the methodological quality of controlled studies on the results of a meta-analysis regarding overall survival. Between April and August 2022, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science were systematically searched. In addition, reference lists of previously published meta-analyses were checked for relevant publications. A random effects meta-analysis with clustering was performed. The risk of bias within the studies was assessed using ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I. The search identified 4685 hits, and 28 publications reporting on 28 298 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Overall, the analysis led to a significant result in favor of mistletoe therapy (overall HR\u2009=\u20090.61 with 95% CI [0.53;0.7]). According to our subgroup analysis of randomized studies, studies of higher quality (lower risk of bias) did not lead to a significant result in favor of mistletoe therapy (HR\u2009=\u20090.78; CI\u2009=\u2009[0.30; 2.00]). In the case of mistletoe therapy, the results of the meta-analysis strongly depended on the methodological quality of the included studies. Calculating meta-analyses that include low-quality studies may lead to severe misinterpretation of the data.'}

Conversely, carbon-11 (11C) labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PIB)-PET imaging is exclusively used for the detection of IBM. This research is designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT in identifying IIM by employing rigorous diagnostic accuracy testing methodologies. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, and Embase. We focused on the diagnostic utility of PET/CT in IIM, assessing sensitivities, specificities, and deriving likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-). The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022343222). This systematic review identified 635 citations, of which 10 eligible trials were included, with a total of 419 participants. The results indicated a sensitivity of 0.86 (0.81-0.90), and a specificity of 0.93 (0.88-0.96). The synthesis of LR revealed the LR+ of 10.35 (6.31-16.98), and LR-of 0.15 (0.07-0.32). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9658. Regarding IBM, the sensitivity was 0.84 (0.60-0.97), and the specificity was 1 (0.69-1). The synthesis of LR showed the LR+ of 9.61 (1.46-63.15) and an LR- of 0.21 (0.09-0.51). For disease activity, the sensitivity was 0.96 (0.92-0.99), and the specificity was 0.91 (0.084-0.96). The synthesis of LR showed an LR+ of 9.43 (5.39-16.51) and an LR- of 0.05 (0.02-0.11). Positron emission tomography/CT has great potential for accurately diagnosing and monitoring patients with IIM, and may have implications for their clinical management.'}

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of ET versus OSR for traumatic lower extremity artery injury. The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Databases were searched for studies. Cohort studies and case series reporting outcomes of ET or OSR were eligible for inclusion. Robins-I tool and an 18-item tool were used to assess the risk of bias. The primary outcome was amputation. The secondary outcomes included fasciotomy or compartment syndrome, mortality, length of stay and lower extremity nerve injury. We used the random effects model to calculate pooled estimates. A total of 32 studies with low or moderate risk of bias were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that patients who underwent ET had a significantly decreased risk of major amputation (OR\u2009=\u20090.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85; I2=34%) and fasciotomy or compartment syndrome (OR\u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI 0.20-0.50, I2\u2009=\u200914%) than patients who underwent OSR.

Patients with ET repair had a shorter length of stay than patients with OSR repair (MD=-5.06, 95% CI -6.76 to\u2009-3.36, I2\u2009=\u200965%). Intraoperative nerve injury was just reported in OSR patients with a pooled incidence of 15% (95% CI 6%-27%). Endovascular therapy may represent a better choice for patients with traumatic lower extremity arterial injury, because it can provide lower risks of amputation, fasciotomy or compartment syndrome, and nerve injury, as well as shorter length of stay.'}

Platelet rich plasma (PRP) ovarian injection is a potential treatment method, but the treatment methods are different, and the treatment results are controversial. This study adopts a systematic review and meta-analysis method based on clinical research to explore the efficacy and safety of PRP injection on POR. The following databases were searched for research published before March 2023; Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI). The literature was then screened by two independent researchers, who extracted the data and evaluated its quality. Research was selected according to the inclusion criteria, and its quality was evaluated according to the NOS standard Cohort study. The bias risk of the included study was assessed with STATE 14.0. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Ten studies were included in the analysis, including 7 prospective cohort studies and 3 retrospective studies involving 836 patients. The results showed that after PRP treatment, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) significantly decreased and anti-Mueller hormone (AMH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) significantly increased in POR patients, but estradiol did not change significantly; The number of antral follicles increased, and the number of obtaining eggs and mature oocytes significantly increased; The number of Metaphase type II oocytes, 2PN and high-quality embryos, and cleavage stage embryos significantly increased. In addition, the patient cycle cancellation rates significantly decreased. The rate of natural pregnancy assisted reproductive pregnancy and live birth increased significantly. Four reports made it clear that no adverse reactions were observed. PRP may have the potential to improve pre-assisted reproductive indicators in POR patients, increase the success rate of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in POR patients, and improve embryo quality, and may be beneficial to the pregnancy outcome. There is no obvious potential risk in this study, but further clinical support is still needed.'}

However, the clinical significance of TRIM proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the association between TRIM proteins and the clinicopathological features and survival outcomes in patients with CRC. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate whether TRIM is a prognostic factor in CRC. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and Weipu databases were searched to identify eligible studies that evaluated the association between TRIM proteins and overall survival (OS), as well as the clinicopathological features of patients with CRC. Hazard ratios (HR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived and pooled using a fixed-effects model. From inception to March 2023, we extracted study characteristics and prognostic data for each identified study. Twelve studies enrolling 1608 patients were eligible for inclusion. Data on OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were available for 12 and 2 studies, respectively. The pooled analysis results showed a significant correlation between the elevated TRIM proteins and shorter OS (HR = 2.42, 95% CI: 1.96-2.99) and worse RFS (HR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.78-3.54) in patients with CRC. The combined ORs indicated that TRIM protein over-expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.25-4.10), deep tumor invasion (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.04-3.88), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 2.19-4.09) and perineural invasion (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.18-3.23). Our findings suggest that TRIM proteins can predict tumor progression and poor prognosis in CRC. Therefore, TRIM proteins may be promising therapeutic targets for patients with CRC.'}

Baclofen is one of only a few options for treating spasticity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy on severe40.23 spasticity and motor function in patients with cerebral palsy. We conducted a systematic review in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We included studies based on eligibility criteria that included desired participants (cerebral palsy patients with spasticity), interventions (intrathecal baclofen), and outcomes (the Ashworth scales and the Gross Motor Function Measure [GMFM]). The within-group Cohen's d standardized mean differences (SMD) were analyzed using the random effect model. We screened 768 papers and included 19 in the severity of spasticity section and 6 in the motor function section. The pre-intervention average spasticity score (SD) was 3.2 (0.78), and the post-intervention average score (SD) was 1.9 (0.72), showing a 40.25% reduction. The SMD for spasticity reduction was -\u20091.7000 (95% CI [-2.1546; -1.2454], p-value\u2009<\u20090.0001), involving 343 patients with a weighted average age of 15.78 years and a weighted average baclofen dose of 289 µg/day. The SMD for the MAS and Ashworth Scale subgroups were -\u20091.7845 (95% CI [-2.8704; -0.6986]) and -\u20091.4837 (95% CI [-1.8585; -1.1088]), respectively. We found no relationship between the participants' mean age, baclofen dose, measurement time, and the results. The pre-intervention average GMFM (SD) was 40.03 (26.01), and the post-intervention average score (SD) was 43.88 (26.18), showing a 9.62% increase. The SMD for motor function using GMFM was 0.1503 (95% CI [0.0784; 0.2223], p-value\u2009=\u20090.0030), involving 117 patients with a weighted average age of 13.63 and a weighted average baclofen dose of 203 µg/day.

It serves as an indirect contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity. Mothers in the postpartum period experience diminished quality of life, impaired cognitive function, emotional instability, and an increased risk of postpartum depression due to anemia. Additionally, infants of affected mothers may face challenges such as insufficient breast milk supply and a lack of proper care. Examining the combined prevalence and factors associated with postpartum anemia is crucial for addressing maternal health risks and complications during the postnatal phase attributed to anemia. The study aimed to synthesize the existing literature on the prevalence and associated factors of postpartum anemia in public health facilities of Ethiopia, in 2024. The study was conducted by searching through the Google Scholar, PubMed, and Cochrane Library search engines. The search utilized keywords and MeSH terms such as anemia, low hemoglobin, postpartum, postnatal women, and Ethiopia. The collected data underwent analysis and comparison with the WHO criteria to determine if it met the threshold for declaring a public health concern. Heterogeneity was evaluated through the Cochran Q test and I2 statistics. Prevalence and odds ratio estimations were performed using a random-effects model with a 95% confidence interval. Four studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of anemia among postpartum women in Ethiopia was 69% (95% CI: 60- 77%).Lack of formal education(OR\u2009=\u20093.5;CI:2.639,4.408),Low Pre-delivery hemoglobin (OR\u2009=\u20094.2;CI: 1.768-6.668), Postpartum women\u2009<\u20094 ANC visit (OR\u2009=\u20092.72; 95% CI:2.14,3.3 ),history of post partum hemorrhage (OR\u2009=\u20092.49; CI: 1.075-3.978),history of Forceps/vacuum delivery(OR\u2009=\u20093.96; CI:2.986-4.947), Poor iron and folic acid adherence (OR\u2009=\u20092.8;95% CI:2.311,3.297), C/S (OR\u2009=\u20094.04; 95% CI: 3.426,4.671),lower dietary diversity (OR\u2009=\u20094.295% CI:1.768,6.668) were significantly associated postpartum anemia. Postpartum women in Ethiopia continue to face a considerable public health challenge in the form of anemia. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the government to formulate comprehensive, multi-sectorial policies and strategies. These initiatives should be designed to address the substantial regional disparities influenced by interconnected factors, with the aim of reducing the prevalence of anemia among postpartum women in Ethiopia.'}

However, the long-term effects, adverse events, and appropriate target BP level are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of nurse-led interventions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and CINAHL, as well as three Japanese article databases, as relevant randomized controlled trials from the oldest possible to March 2021. This search was conducted on 17 April 2021. We did an update search on 17 October 2023. We included studies on adults aged 18 years or older with hypertension. The treatments of interest were community-based nurse-led BP control interventions in addition to primary physician-provided care as usual. The comparator was usual care only. Primary outcomes were long-term achievement of BP control goals and serious adverse events (range: 27 weeks to 3 years). Secondary outcomes were short-term achievement of BP control goals and serious adverse events (range: 4 to 26 weeks), change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline, medication adherence, incidence of hypertensive complications, and total mortality. We included 35 studies. Nurse-led interventions improved long-term BP control (RR 1.10, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.18). However, no significant differences were found in the short-term effects of nurse-led intervention compared to usual care about BP targets. Little information on serious adverse events was available. There was no difference in mortality at both terms between the two groups. Establishing the appropriate target BP from the extant trials was impossible. Nurse-led interventions may be more effective than usual care for achieving BP control at long-term follow-up. It is important to continue lifestyle modification for people with hypertension. We must pay attention to adverse events, and more studies examining appropriate BP targets are needed. Nurse-led care represents an important complement to primary physician-led usual care.'}

The value of topical vancomycin and gentamicin for sternal wound infections (SWI) prophylaxis was further questioned by recent studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to comprehensively assess the safety and effectiveness of RAD to reduce the risk of SWI.We screened multiple databases for RCTs assessing the effectiveness of RAD (vancomycin, gentamicin) in SWI prophylaxis. Random effects meta-analysis was performed. The primary endpoint was any SWI; other wound complications were also analysed. Odds Ratios served as the primary statistical analyses. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed.Thirteen RCTs (N\u2009=\u20097,719 patients) were included. The odds of any SWI were significantly reduced by over 50% with any RAD: OR (95%CIs): 0.49 (0.35-0.68); p\u2009<\u20090.001 and consistently reduced in vancomycin (0.34 [0.18-0.64]; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and gentamicin (0.58 [0.39-0.86]; p\u2009=\u20090.007) groups (psubgroup\u2009=\u20090.15). Similarly, RAD reduced the odds of SWI in diabetic and non-diabetic patients (0.46 [0.32-0.65]; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 0.60 [0.44-0.83]; p\u2009=\u20090.002 respectively). Cumulative Z-curve passed the TSA-adjusted boundary for SWIs suggesting adequate power has been met and no further trials are needed. RAD significantly reduced deep (0.60 [0.43-0.83]; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and superficial SWIs (0.54 [0.32-0.91]; p\u2009=\u20090.02). No differences were seen in mediastinitis and mortality, however, limited number of studies assessed these endpoints. There was no evidence of systemic toxicity, sternal dehiscence and resistant strains emergence. Both vancomycin and gentamicin reduced the odds of cultures outside their respective serum concentrations' activity: vancomycin against gram-negative strains: 0.20 (0.01-4.18) and gentamicin against gram-positive strains: 0.42 (0.28-0.62); P\u2009<\u20090.001. Regional antibiotic delivery is safe and effectively reduces the risk of SWI in cardiac surgery patients."}
